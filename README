Sir Sync-A-Lot. An optimised S3 sync tool using the power of *nix!

Requirements:

  * Ruby
  * RubyGems
  * aws-s3 RubyGem
  * OpenSSL

To configure, run './sir-sync-a-lot setup' and follow the prompts, you'll
need your S3 keys, the local file path you want to back up, the bucket name
to back up to, and any extra options to pass into find (i.e. for ignoring
filepaths etc).

Then to sync, run './sir-sync-a-lot sync' and away she goes.

This library was written because we needed to be able to back up craploads of
data without having to worry about if we had enough disk space on the origin. 
That's where S3 is nice. 

But we wanted an rsync-like tool that wasn't s3sync coz we had to run this on 
our web server that is already high traffic, without upsetting it too much. Using 
find, xargs and openssl shell tools we very quickly and efficently checksum a large 
number of files.

The backup tool is also stateful, it remembers when the last sync was run and will
use find -cmin instead of a full checksum comparison on each file. Much faster!

Caveats: No tests (yet), find -ctime borked, better logging on the way, etc.

Have fun!

in production environments!
