Sir Sync-A-Lot. An optimised S3 sync tool using the power of *nix!

Requirements:

  * Ruby
  * RubyGems
  * aws-s3 RubyGem
  * OpenSSL

To configure, run './sir-sync-a-lot setup' and follow the prompts, you'll
need your S3 keys, the local file path you want to back up, the bucket name
to back up to, and any extra options to pass into find (i.e. for ignoring
filepaths etc).

Then to sync, run './sir-sync-a-lot sync' and away she goes.

This library was written because we needed to be able to back up craploads of
data without having to worry about if we had enough disk space on the origin. 
That's where S3 is nice. 

EDIT: Damn these things go outta date quickly. Just look at the commit log for
info on how it's changing or changed and junk. Gah!

FYI when you run the sync, the output will look something like this:

  [Thu Apr 01 11:50:25 +1100 2010] Starting, performing pre-sync checks...
  [Thu Apr 01 11:50:26 +1100 2010] Generating local manifest...

  [Thu Apr 01 11:50:31 +1100 2010] Done like a dinner.

You could pipe sync into a log file, which might be nice.

Have fun!
