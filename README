Sir Sync-A-Lot. An optimised S3 sync tool using the power of *nix!

Requirements:

  * Ruby
  * RubyGems
  * aws-s3 RubyGem
  * OpenSSL

To configure, run './sir-sync-a-lot setup' and follow the prompts, you'll
need your S3 keys, the local file path you want to back up, the bucket name
to back up to, and any extra options to pass into find (i.e. for ignoring
filepaths etc).

Then to sync, run './sir-sync-a-lot sync' and away she goes.

This library was written because we needed to be able to back up craploads of
data without having to worry about if we had enough disk space on the origin. 
That's where S3 is nice. 

EDIT: Damn these things go outta date quickly. Just look at the commit log for
info on how it's changing or changed and junk. Gah!

Have fun!

Project wholy sponsored by Envato Pty Ltd. They're the shizzy! P.S. We use this
in production environments!
